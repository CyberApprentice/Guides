Installing snort on my raspberry pi 3 B+. I wanted to use Moloch but it only runs 64-bit amd processors and mine is a 32-bit armhfv7 unfortunately. So, i'm going to get back to my roots and setup snort with ELK stack as a sniffer for my personal home setup to get some network analysis training and have a use for my pi3.

1) Set up raspberry pi as a MITM device
    # sudo apt-get install dnsmasq 
    # sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
        - interface eth1
            static ip_address=172.24.1.1/24
    # sudo service dhcpcd restart
    # sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig  
    # sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
        - interface=eth1      # Use interface wlan0  
            bind-interfaces      # Bind to the interface to make sure we aren't sending things elsewhere  
            server=8.8.8.8       # Forward DNS requests to Google DNS  
            domain-needed        # Don't forward short names  
            bogus-priv           # Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.  
            dhcp-range=172.24.1.50,172.24.1.150,12h # Assign IP addresses between 172.24.1.50 and 172.24.1.150 with a 12 hour lease time
    # sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
        - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 #uncomment this line
    # sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
    # sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE  
        sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  
        sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
    # sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
        - OR
        # iptables-save
    # sudo nano /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/70-ipv4-nat
    # iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat  
    # sudo service dnsmasq start
    # sudo reboot

    ***** if dhcpcd status is erroring, "failed to start dhcpcd on all interfaces"... do this!****
    It means you have more than 1 client running. You need to delete one.
    # dpkg -l | grep dhcp
    # apt-get remove dhcpcd
        - or sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd.service
